About Me

My name is Lynnea Dale, and I'm a first-year student studying Business at Idaho State University. I love music and baking, and come from a fairly musical family. My best friend and her mother are excellent bakers, which gave me the idea for my senior project, which focused on the history of American cooking. My experience of working on that project led me to aspire to a culinary career, which I hope to work towards while I'm at ISU. I plan to attend the Culinary Institute of America after graduating from ISU with a Bachelor's Degree in Business. Upon graduating from the CIA, I hope to open my own patisserie/deli and, eventually, a cafe.
